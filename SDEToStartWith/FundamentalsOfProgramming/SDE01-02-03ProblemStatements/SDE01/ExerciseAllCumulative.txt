Code Camp Exercises focussed on Problem Solving...
Code Camp Exercise 1
Take an Array of N Integers
2. Accept an input m
3. The algorithm should pick elements from the array and sum them so that it gives the value m
4. if the above is not possible then it should return -1 otherwise it should return 1 and display
the elements used to make the sum.
Example Consider an array of integers say 5
(12, 36, 22, 19, 63)
User wants to make sum of 31 from this array
so it should pick 12+19=31

Code Camp Exercise 2
Write a function:
char * solution(char *S, char *T);
that, given two strings S and T consisting of N and M characters, respectively, determines whether string T can be obtained from string S by at most one insertion or deletion of a character, or by swapping two adjacent characters once. The function should return a string:
"INSERT c" if string T can be obtained from string S by inserting a single character "c";
"DELETE c" if string T can be obtained from string S by deleting a single character "c";
"SWAP c d" if string T can be obtained from string S by swapping two adjacent characters "c" and "d" (these characters should be distinct and they should be in this order in string S);
"NOTHING" if no operation is needed (strings T and S are equal);
"IMPOSSIBLE" if none of the above works.
For example, given S = "nice" and T = "niece", the function should return "INSERT e". Given S = "form" and T = "from", the function should return "SWAP o r". Given S = "o" and T = "odd", the function should return "IMPOSSIBLE".
Assume that:
        N and M are integers within the range [1..100];
        string S consists only of lower-case letters (a-z);
        string T consists only of lower-case letters (a-z).
